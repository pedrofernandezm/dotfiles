# Dotfiles

## What are dotfiles?
Dotfiles are basically plain text files that start with a '.' and are use to set
preferences for things like Git and Vim. To see your current dotfiles, open a
terminal and in your home folder run this:

```
$ ls -a
```

## Install

First clone the repo:

```
$ git clone --recurse-submodules git@github.com:pedrofernandezm/dotfiles.git
```

Then cd into the dotfiles directory and run this script:

```
$ cd dotfiles
$ bin/install
```

This will symlink all dotfiles into your home directory.

This script will only install files that do not already exist in your $HOME
directory. if you have, e.g. your own .vimrc file, the script will rename it as
.vimrc.old so you can get what you need from there and move it into
~/.vimrc.local. Do not worry! Dotfiles will source it for you.

### Extras

This script will install extra tools required for some plugins functionality.
It's not mandatory to install the extras, but it is highly recommended. The
script will work on Mac or Linux (Ubuntu):

```
bin/extras.sh
```

It will install:

- Silver Searcher (Vim)
- Autojump (Oh-My-Zsh)

## Update

To keep dotfiles up to date, just go into dotfiles home directory and run:

```
$ git pull --rebase
$ bin/install
```

## Uninstall

Cd into dotfiles home directory and run this script:

```
$ bin/uninstall
```
